# Feedback Application

This project is a feedback application built with TypeScript, featuring a React frontend and a Node.js backend. Users can submit feedback through the frontend, which communicates with the backend to store and retrieve feedback data.

Most of the code and structure of this application has been generated with Copilot.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories: `frontend` and `backend`.

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd feedback-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   - For the frontend:
     ```
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```
   - For the backend:
     ```
     cd ../backend
     npm install
     ```

3. **Run the applications**:
   - Start the backend server:
     ```
     cd backend
     npm start
     ```
   - Start the frontend application:
     ```
     cd frontend
     npm start
     ```

## Usage

Once both the frontend and backend are running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to access the feedback application. Users can fill out the feedback form and submit their feedback, which will be processed by the backend.
